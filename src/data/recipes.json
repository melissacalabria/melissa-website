Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden brown (about 5-7 minutes). Remove from the pan and set aside.\n\n2. **Start the Risotto:** \n   In the same pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent (about 3-4 minutes). Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.\n\n3. **Toast the Rice:** \n   Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat each grain with oil. Toast the rice for 1-2 minutes until it becomes slightly translucent.\n\n4. **Add Wine:** \n   Pour in the white wine and stir constantly until it's mostly absorbed by the rice.\n\n5. **Gradually Add Broth:** \n   Begin adding the warm vegetable broth, one ladle at a time. Stir frequently and wait for each addition to be mostly absorbed before adding more. This process should take about 18-20 minutes.\n\n6. **Final Touches:** \n   When the rice is al dente and creamy, stir in the cooked mushrooms, vegan butter, nutritional yeast, and fresh thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7. **Serve:** \n   Let the risotto rest for 2 minutes, then serve immediately. If desired, drizzle with a small amount of truffle oil for an extra luxurious touch.\n\n> **Chef's Tip:** For an even creamier texture, try stirring in a dollop of cashew cream at the end of cooking.\n\n**Enjoy your homemade vegan mushroom risotto!**"
